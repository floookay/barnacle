## main

You'll have to split the shell piece into two pieces in the slicer at the groove (the bridge should not be printed). It's not important if the cut removes a little bit of material above the groove. This will be hidden later.

The plate is sandwiched in between the shell and fixer pieces. You can customize the spreadsheet in the FreeCAD file if you are having troubles with the tolerances (it's very tight).
