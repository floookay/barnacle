## shell pcb

- fixed layout, so I chose hotswap sockets
- rgb underglow
- per key rgb

## core pcb

You can use any core pcb with a shell. They are smaller than 100mmx100mm so it's relativly cheap to get a small batch made.

### versatile core

This is a great starting point if you want to experiment with different layouts and don't care too much about hot swap ability.

The following configurations are supported:
- 9 keys
- 3 keys and a encoder with a big knob
- 3 keys and a 0.96"/1.3" OLED screen
- 2 small encoders, 1 key and a 0.96" OLED screen
- a central encoder with the biggest knob

### encoder core

This core has three top keys and a encoder beneath like the versatile core with hot swap sockets.

### special core

This core exposes I2C and SPI pins and has a large cutout for mounting a trackball, trackpad or large oled to the core case (WIP).

### numblock core

This core has a 3x3 grid of keys like the versatile core but with hot swap sockets.

### cute core

This core has centered 2x2 grid of keys with hot swap sockets.

### oled core

This core has various positions for oled screens.
